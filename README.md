## What is Greekum Ipsum?
Original description:

> Greekum Ipsum is variation of Lorem Ipsum. It was made by [Krzysztof Szewczyk](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk), serving same purpose as Lorem Ipsum, with another feature - creating generators of this, or even trying it out in applications or websites, can test system's capability to render unicode characters.

### C# TODO list:
 * [X] Allow application to start clean
 * [ ] Add Learn(char) and Learn(string) methods to GreekumIpsum
 * [X] Move GreekumIpsum classes to separate package, avoiding global namespace pollution
 * [X] Add some form of config files <-- It's JavaScript's problem
 * [ ] Add more friendly API
 * [ ] [1]: Compile Greekum-Harvester to JavaScript and open-source it (it's tool to grab statistics from eg. text file)
 * [ ] Allow to emit markdown
 * [X] Integrate for loop
 * [X] Split runtime and code
